# Setup
We have tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.5<br>


### Prerequisites
Install the HIL SDK from Quanser.<br>
A mirror is available at https://github.com/quanser/hil_sdk_linux_x86_64.<br>

You can install the driver by:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/quanser/hil_sdk_linux_x86_64.git
    sudo chmod a+x ./hil_sdk_linux_x86_64/setup_hil_sdk ./hil_sdk_linux_x86_64/uninstall_hil_sdk
    sudo ./hil_sdk_linux_x86_64/setup_hil_sdk
```

You also must have pip installed:
```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```


### Installation
We recommend that you use a virtual environment such as [conda (recommended)](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/), or [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can install the driver by cloning and pip-installing:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BlueRiverTech/quanser-openai-driver.git
    cd quanser-openai-driver
    pip3 install -e .
```

Once you have that setup: Run the classical control baseline (ensure the Qube is connected to your computer)<br>
```bash
python tests/test.py --env QubeSwingupEnv --control flip
```


# Usage
Usage is very similar to most OpenAI gym environments but **requires** that you close the environment when finished.
Without safely closing the Env, bad things may happen. Usually you will not be able to reopen the board.

This can be done with a context manager using a `with` statement
```python
import gym
from gym_brt import QubeSwingupEnv

num_episodes = 10
num_steps = 250

with QubeSwingupEnv() as env:
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        for step in range(num_steps):
            action = env.action_space.sample()
            state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
```

Or can be closed manually by using `env.close()`. You can see an [example here](docs/alternatives.md#usage).
